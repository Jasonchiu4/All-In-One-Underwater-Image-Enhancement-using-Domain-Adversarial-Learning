# All-In-One-Underwater-Image-Enhancement-using-Domain-Adversarial-Learning

Code for All-In-One Underwater Image Enhancement using Domain-Adversarial Learning [[paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/html/UG2_Prize_Challenge/Uplavikar_All-in-One_Underwater_Image_Enhancement_Using_Domain-Adversarial_Learning_CVPRW_2019_paper.html)] [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13342)]

Synthesized [NYU Depth V2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html) Underwater Dataset based on [Anwar et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03528)

All the dependencies can be installed by creating a conda environment from the `environment.yml` file as follows

```conda env create --name envname -f=environments.yml```

Some parts of code adopted from https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet and https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
